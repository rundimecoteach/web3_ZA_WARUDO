He is the author of the 1998 book War in the Blood: Sex Politics and AIDS in Southeast Asia and is currently conducting projects in Thailand, China, Burma, Malawi, Tanzania, South Africa, Kazakhstan and Russia.</p>
<p>Beyrer serves as an adviser to numerous organizations, including the Public Health Program of the Open Society Institute, the Institute for Asian Democracy, the Asia Society’s Social Issues Program and the HIV Vaccine and Prevention Trials Networks.
