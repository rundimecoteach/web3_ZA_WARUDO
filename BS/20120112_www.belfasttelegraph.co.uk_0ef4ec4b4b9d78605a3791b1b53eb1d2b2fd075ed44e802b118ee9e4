<p>                    Wednesday Jan 11 2012</p>
<p>            </p>
<p>After Belfast model Gemma Garrett found out she was among thousands who had </p>
<p>  faulty breast implants, her advice now to women is to be happy with what </p>
<p>  nature provided. </p>
<p>Gemma Garrett is angry and it’s not difficult to understand why. Still healing </p>
<p>  eight months after surgery to remove ruptured PIP breast implants, the </p>
<p>  30-year-old Belfast model has no idea if there is a lasting risk to her </p>
<p>  health. </p>
<p>It doesn’t help that Gemma now believes she was wrongly advised to have </p>
<p>  implants in the first place and that there were other less invasive medical </p>
<p>  options open to her. </p>
<p>And she claims that the surgeon she consulted and who performed the operation </p>
<p>  — and who now won’t return her calls — should have informed her that he was </p>
<p>  using the cheaper option of Poly Implant Prothese implants — the current </p>
<p>  cause of a huge global health scare. </p>
<p>But most of all she is angry at herself — for being too trusting of a medical </p>
<p>  professional and for not carrying out more thorough research before opting </p>
<p>  to follow his advice. </p>
<p>Determined to channel the strong emotion which has followed her horrific </p>
<p>  ordeal into something positive Gemma has launched a personal crusade to </p>
<p>  persuade young girls against having a breast enlargement. </p>
<p>She says: “I’ve learnt a very hard lesson. </p>
<p>“Fortunately I am healthy at the minute and I can only hope there are no </p>
<p>  lasting effects but no one can tell me for sure. </p>
<p>“I think big boobs are overrated and it horrifies me how many young girls at </p>
<p>  just 17 and 18 years old are making the decision, supported by parents, to </p>
<p>  have breast implants. </p>
<p>“In many cases their breasts haven’t even finished growing. I want to campaign </p>
<p>  to warn them that it is not as glamorous as they think and that they will </p>
<p>  have to find the money to go through surgery all over again after 10 years, </p>
<p>  something else which I wasn’t told.”</p>
<p>Gemma, a former Miss Great Britain had surgery in 2008, not because she wanted </p>
<p>  to be a larger cup size but because she was self conscious that one of her </p>
<p>  breasts was bigger than the other. </p>
<p>Working as a model at the time made her even more aware of the difference and </p>
<p>  she decided to seek the advice of a breast surgeon to see if she could have </p>
<p>  corrective surgery. </p>
<p>“I didn’t want larger boobs. I was a size 8-10 at the time and my breasts were </p>
<p>  a full C cup or even a D cup which I was happy with,” she says. </p>
<p>Gemma went online to research breast surgeons and in the end opted for a </p>
<p>  London consultant who had been recommended by model friends in the city. </p>
<p>He recommended breast implants to correct the size variance in her breasts </p>
<p>  although Gemma later discovered there were corrective surgery options open </p>
<p>  to her which he didn’t mention. </p>
<p>At £5,000, the cost of the surgery was more than double what many other places </p>
<p>  were charging but this only served to reassure Gemma that she was paying for </p>
<p>  the best. </p>
<p>She says: “I had just got my first big modeling pay cheque and even though I </p>
<p>  could have got it done a lot cheaper elsewhere I thought I was paying more </p>
<p>  because it was the best hospital and the best surgeon and that actually gave </p>
<p>  me confidence about it.”</p>
<p>Gemma was told her implants would be silicone but PIP was not mentioned. </p>
<p>It has since emerged that the controversial implants which originated in </p>
<p>  France are filled with industrial chemicals including those used as fuel </p>
<p>  additives or for the manufacture of industrial rubber tubing. </p>
<p>It was last spring when Gemma discovered one of her breasts had become lumpy </p>
<p>  and decided to visit her GP who advised that she contact her implant </p>
<p>  surgeon. </p>
<p>After several unsuccessful attempts to get in touch with him an increasingly </p>
<p>  worried Gemma made an appointment with another specialist at a clinic in </p>
<p>  London’s Harley Street to have her breasts examined. </p>
<p>She says: “As well as the lumps I had been feeling quite tired and drained </p>
<p>  even though I was very active. </p>
<p>“When I went to Harley Street the consultant warned me that my implants could </p>
<p>  be PIP and his advice was that I get them out straight away. </p>
<p>“I was really, really scared, and the truth is, I still am. I didn’t know the </p>
<p>  lasting effects and I’m angry about that. </p>
<p>“I had to wait two weeks for surgery and it was like hell because I just </p>
<p>  wanted them out. </p>
<p>“I had heard about PIP implants as there had been a wee bit of press on them </p>
<p>  but nothing like the scandal there is now. It was enough to worry me though. </p>
<p>  The operation itself was major and when I came round the surgeon was shaking </p>
<p>  his head and saying: ‘I can’t believe they did this to you’. </p>
<p>“He said he had done what he could, but some silicone had fused into my </p>
<p>  breast. </p>
<p>“I felt a million times better as soon as they were taken out. I was left with </p>
<p>  huge cavities where the implants were. </p>
<p>“Every six weeks, I go to hospital, have a needle inserted and the blood which </p>
<p>  has filled the cavities drained. It’s painful and unpleasant. I’m told the </p>
<p>  cavities will close eventually. </p>
<p>“It’s pretty disgusting but I think it is important to talk about it to show </p>
<p>  young people the less glamorous side to it.” </p>
<p>Gemma’s operation cost her £11,000 and she feels fortunate that she could </p>
<p>  afford to pay for it. </p>
<p>Her breasts are scarred but are still healing and she has been assured that </p>
<p>  any permanent scarring will be minimal. </p>
<p>She feels strongly that all women with PIP implants should have them removed </p>
<p>  and believes both the Government and the breast clinics should provide </p>
<p>  financial support for those who can’t afford it. </p>
<p>The French Government is to pay for 30,000 women with the implants to have </p>
<p>  them removed. </p>
<p>But the UK Government has played down any health fears for the 40,000 women in </p>
<p>  the UK believed to have had the surgery. </p>
<p>She says: “It is scary that they are telling people not to worry about it if </p>
<p>  it hasn't opened up. </p>
<p>“I think if you have PIPs, or are in any doubt that you may have them, then </p>
<p>  you need to get them taken out. </p>
<p>“It makes me angry that the French who made them are saying they have to be </p>
<p>  taken out and yet the British Government is not </p>
<p>“Ultimately I think the surgeons are responsible as they bought in these cheap </p>
<p>  products. </p>
<p>“It has been said that women have got themselves into this sittuation because </p>
<p>  of vanity but I would say to that, ‘what about smokers who get lung cancer </p>
<p>  or sun worshippers who get skin cancer’? They know the risks, these women </p>
<p>  didn’t. </p>
<p>“The Government can’t just leave them with the risk of these things leaking </p>
<p>  into their systems. </p>
<p>“And the women shouldn’t have to pay as that means the clinics that caused the </p>
<p>  problem in the first place are getting even more money for the mistake they </p>
<p>  made.”</p>
<p>more than nature intended</p>
<p>Even celebrities don’t always get the figures they hoped for.</p>
<p>Victoria Beckham: After a few years with implants Posh has had hers removed.</p>
<p> Pamela Anderson: The pneumatic blonde is the grand dame of boob jobs having had </p>
<p>      both enhancement and reductions, resulting in a mis-shaped cleavage.</p>
<p> Chelsee Healey: The actress’s super-inflated chest almost caused a </p>
<p>      wardrobe malfunction on Strictly.</p>
<p>Tori Spelling : Told Good Morning that, as a mum, one of her biggest regrets </p>
<p>      is having breast implants. </p>
<p>“I got my boobs done in my early 20's and if I had known it would or could </p>
<p>  possibly have impacted production of milk I would never had had them done,” </p>
<p>  she admitted.</p>
<p>... and leading from the front</p>
<p>But for others the op left them looking swell.</p>
<p>Katie Price: Pumped up her |figure to a DD cup to kickstart her modelling career, </p>
<p>      then got a reduction while married to Peter Andre.</p>
<p>Alex Curran: Married to Liverpool footballer Steven Gerrard, she got a boob </p>
<p>      job aged 18 and has since warned young women against getting an enhancement.</p>
<p>Kelly Rowland: Has been open about her decision to go under the knife, explaining </p>
<p>      that she had breast implants because she was tired of having “little </p>
<p>      nuggets for boobs”.</p>
<p>... meanwhile, keeping it real</p>
<p> Kelly Brook, Jennifer Aniston and Christina Hendricks</p>
<p>... from ivory to silicone</p>
<p>In 1895 surgeon Vincenz Czerny was the first to effect a breast implant emplacement </p>
<p>      when he harvested tissue from a benign lumbar lipoma to repair the asymmetry </p>
<p>      of the breast from which he had removed a tumor.</p>
<p> In 1889 surgeon Robert Gersuny experimented with paraffin injections with disastrous </p>
<p>      results. </p>
<p> From the first half of the 20th century physicians used other substances as breast </p>
<p>      implant fillers including ivory, glass balls, ground rubber, ox cartilage </p>
<p>      and Terylene wool. Unsurprisingly, infections were common.</p>
<p> After World War II Japanese prostitutes trying to attract American servicemen revolutionised </p>
<p>      breast implants by having silicone injected into their breasts.</p>
<p> In 1961 the first silicone breast prosthesis, filled with silicone gel, was developed </p>
<p>      in America.</p>
